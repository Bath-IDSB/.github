#Institute for Digital Security and Behaviour

The Institute for Digital Security and Behaviour in the University of Bath launched in 2024 under the leadership of co-Directors Professor Laura Smith and Professor Adam Joinson.

The purpose of the Institute is to solve global security challenges through world-leading, interdisciplinary, socio-technical research that co-creates inclusive security solutions by adopting a “whole of society” approach. 

Our mission is to produce interdisciplinary research that puts people at the heart of digital security. 

The Institute will help make the UK a more innovative, secure and resilient digital society, develop the next generation of experts in digital security and behaviour and advance the UK as a global leader in digital security. 

Our goal is to help create a safer, more secure, digital world.
